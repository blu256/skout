Skout
-----

Skout is a panel for TDE in the spirit of Deskbar, the desktop panel of BeOS and now Haiku.

enough to be daily-driven.

* Integration with ksystraycmd to place any application windows in system tray
* Close integration with Trinity Desktop Environment

* Task manager

Experimental features (not built by default, include bugs):

* Pager applet (just use KPager for now)
