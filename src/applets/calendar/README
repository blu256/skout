This is a very basic Skout applet which can serve as an example for creating
more advanced applets.

It is thoroughly commented and kept as much barebones as possible without
sacrificing usability.

Here is a basic file structure of a Skout applet:
    - CMakeLists.txt, contains instructions for building the applet with CMake
    - applet_name.desktop, contains information about the applet
    - various implementation files, in this case skout_calendar.{cpp,h}
